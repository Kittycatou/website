## What are paperless patterns?

> ##### Paperless patterns have extra markings to use them without a printer
> The idea is that with the help of the grid and the extra dimensions, 
> you don't need to print the pattern. Instead, you can transfer it
> directly on to fabric, or onto a intermediate medium such as drafting paper.

## Example

### Basic theme

![Pattern output with the basic theme](/img/docs/paperless/basic-sample.svg)

This is an example of the basic theme. Without a printer, there's not much you can do.

### Paperless theme, metric units

This is an example of the paperless theme. The grid and dimensions mean you know what you need to trace even without printing it.

### Paperless theme, imperial units

Similar as above, but for imperial measurements. Note that the dimensions are in inch, and the grid is adapted too.

## How to use this

When you generate a draft, pick the **paperless** theme in the pattern optoins (under **General**).

When you do, your pattern will be rendered in the paperless theme.

> ##### Combine paperless and basic
>
> You don't have to go all-in for paperless. You can generate a paperless pattern and 
> transfer the easy parts.
>
> Then, re-draft your draft and pick the **Basic** theme and choose to only include those parts
> you want.
>
> Both the theme to use and the selection of specific pattern parts to include in your pattern
>are in the **General** section of the pattern options.

## History
When I started writing freesewing, one of the things I wanted to achieve 
was to make it more inclusive (in comparison to makemypattern.com).

For that, I had earmarked two features:

 - Support for multiple languages
 - Find a way for people who don't have access to a printer to still use the patterns

The first one is supported, with translation ongoing. The second is a trickier problem. 

Computer and internet access are much more prevalent than access to a printer and a paper.
To reach as many people as possible, I wanted a way get rid of the requirement of a printer.

After giving it some thought, I decided to try and make patterns that one can 
transfer directly on to fabric, or onto an intermediate medium such as pattern paper.
